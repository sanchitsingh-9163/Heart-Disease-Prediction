# Heart-Disease-Prediction
Overview:

Customer churn, or the loss of customers to a business, can significantly impact a company's revenue and growth. In the telecommunications industry, where competition is fierce and customer loyalty is vital, accurately predicting and mitigating customer churn is of paramount importance. This project aims to build a predictive model using machine learning techniques, particularly a Decision Tree with Grid Search optimization, to forecast which customers are most likely to churn.

Project Goals:

Churn Prediction: Develop a predictive model that can identify customers at risk of churning by analyzing historical data, including customer demographics, usage patterns, and customer service interactions.

Grid Search Optimization: Employ the Grid Search technique to fine-tune hyperparameters for the Decision Tree model, enhancing its predictive accuracy and robustness.

Data Analysis: Analyze the telecommunications company's historical data, including customer information, usage data, and churn records, to identify key factors contributing to churn.

Visualization: Create visualizations to illustrate insights from the data analysis and model performance, making it easier for stakeholders to understand the results.

Key Components:

Data Collection: Gather historical data on customer demographics, usage patterns, billing, and customer service interactions. This data serves as the foundation for the model.

Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and normalizing numerical variables.

Decision Tree Modeling: Train a Decision Tree classifier to predict customer churn. Optimize the model using Grid Search to select the best hyperparameters.

Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Assess its ability to identify potential churners accurately.

Visualizations: Create visualizations, such as confusion matrices, ROC curves, and feature importance plots, to illustrate model performance and insights gained from the data analysis.

Documentation: Maintain a well-structured README file to help users understand the project, how to use the model, and interpret the results.

Benefits:

Churn Reduction: By accurately identifying potential churners, the telecommunications company can take proactive steps to retain these customers, leading to reduced churn rates and increased revenue.

Data-Driven Decision Making: The project promotes data-driven decision-making by providing insights into factors influencing customer churn, enabling the company to tailor its strategies to address these issues.

Efficiency: Automation of the churn prediction process can save time and resources compared to manual analysis.

Scalability: The predictive model can be extended or adapted for use in other industries that deal with customer churn, such as subscription-based services.
